In this project, we are using 64-Channel EEG signals from a patients brain to predict the patients desired finger flexions. The given data consists of a patients EEG data over time and corresponding number (0-5, 0 being none) to indicate a the digit a patient intends to flex over time.  

Most of the analysis is done in mainscript.m
